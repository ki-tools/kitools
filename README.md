# kitools

The kitools R package provides utility functions for setting up Knowledge Integration (Ki) projects and supporting workflows within these projects, such as finding data and publishing results.

This package is in the extreme early development process and is expected to majorly evolve over time.

More documentation will be made available as the package matures.
